# Rally Fighter

The Rally Fighter was a small-run open source production vehicle built by Local Motors. The design and funding to
create it were crowd sourced and the plans were released under the Creative Commons Attribution, Non Commercial, 
Share-Alike license (BY-NC-SA).

The car and company have a fascinating history. They were able to take vehicles from design to production in under
two years and on a shoestring budget by making heavy use of 3D printing, commodity components, and a simple-beats-complex
philosophy. Their intention was to create microfactories around the world which could produce any of their vehicles,
something like a traditional franchise operation but for open source vehicles.

Sadly, Local Motors stopped publishing plans for their vehicles sometime in the mid-2010s around the time they began
to focus heavily on a small autonomous people mover concept vehicle. In 2022, the company shut down abruptly with
little explanation. 

This repo is meant as a place to archive the technical documentation for the Rally Fighter, including CAD models, 
parts lists, and related information.
